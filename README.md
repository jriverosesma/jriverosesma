I’m a AI engineer at [**AIRBUS**](https://www.airbus.com/) ✈️, developing next-generation avionics with cutting-edge ML and CV solutions.

- ⚒️ **Current Work:** Building onboard vision-based applications. Check out the [first fully automatic vision-based take-off on an A350](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TIBeso4abU/).
- 🤖 **ML Focus Areas:** Latency-performance trade-off, model compression (quantization, pruning, etc.), uncertainty quantification, synthetic-real data blending, and custom model architectures.
- 🔬 **Other Interests:** "Classic" CV tasks like pose estimation and stereo vision, multimodal LLMs.
- 📫 **Connect:** [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juanriverosesma/) for more info or to get in touch.
